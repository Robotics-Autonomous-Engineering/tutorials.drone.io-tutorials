The tutorials website hosts community-contributed content with a focus on building, testing and releasing software. Anyone can contribute a tutorial to the website. There is a list of requested topics in our issue tracker. If an issue has the [`sponsored`](https://github.com/drone/tutorials/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsored) label it indicates the topic has a bounty and reward for contribution. 

# Apply
